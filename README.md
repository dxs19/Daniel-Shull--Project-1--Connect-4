3. Include a minimum of 2 event handlers
4. Have at least 20 meaningful git commits. You should be committing your changes every time you build a new feature.
5. Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. DO NOT leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice). Comments, if in your code at all, should be in your code to describe what your functions are doing.
